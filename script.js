        ans:"ans1",
        detail:"<hr> The correct answer is Andhra:- Dhanyakataka (also known as Dharanikota) is located in the present-day Andhra Pradesh state of India. It was a prominent Buddhist center under the Mahasanghikas. It is also believed that the Great Stupa at Amaravati, which is one of the most significant Buddhist monuments in India, was situated in the same region. This monument is a fine example of Buddhist art and architecture, further emphasizing the importance of this region as a Buddhist center. In contrast, Gandhara, located in present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, was also a major center of Buddhist art and culture, but it iss not the region where Dhanyakataka was located. Gandhara is especially known for the Gandhara style of Buddhist art, which incorporated influences from Greek and Roman art."

        question: "With reference to ancient India, consider the following statements :",
        e:"",
        f:"1. The concept of Stupa is Buddhist in origin.",
        g:"2. Stupa was generally a repository of relics.",
        h:"3. Stupa was a votive and commemorative structure in Buddhist tradition.",
        i:"",
        j:"How many of the statements given above are correct?",
        a:"Only one",
        b:"Only two",
        c:"All three",
        d:"None",
        ans:"ans2",
        detail:"<hr>The correct answer is Only two:- Stupa is a pre-Buddhist tumuli in which sramaṇas were buried in a seated position called chaitya. The term “stupa” comes from the Sanskrit word “stupa,” which means “heap” or “pile.” Originally, stupas were simple mounds of earth or stones that served as commemorative markers for important events or burial sites. Hence statement 1 is incorrect. One of the primary purposes of a Stupa was to serve as a repository for relics (sarira) associated with the Buddha or other significant Buddhist figures. These relics were often placed in a central chamber within the Stupa. Hence statement 2 is correct. Besides housing relics, Stupas were often erected to commemorate significant events in the life of the Buddha, such as his birth, enlightenment, first sermon, and death. They also served as a focus for devotional practice. Hence statement 3 is correct."

        d:"shrines of Jain Tirthankaras",
        ans:"ans2",
        detail:"<hr> The correct answer is Ports:- Korkai, Poompuhar, and Muchiri (Muziris) were all well-known ancient ports in South India. Korkai:- Located in present-day Tamil Nadu, Korkai was a major port and the capital of the early Pandyan Kingdom. It was known for its pearl fishery and was a central hub for trade with the Roman Empire. Poompuhar:- Also known as Kaveripoompattinam, it was a significant port city in the Chola kingdom. Located at the mouth of the river Kaveri, it served as an important maritime and trade center. Muchiri (Muziris):- Located near present-day Kodungalloor in Kerala, Muziris was one of the major ports on the Malabar Coast during ancient times. It was a vital link in the maritime trade routes connecting the Mediterranean and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and was famed for its spice trade. Therefore, these cities were not capital cities (though Korkai was an early capital of the Pandyan Kingdom, it is more known as a port), they were not centers of iron-and-steel making, and they were not known as shrines of Jain Tirthankaras. They were best known as important ports facilitating extensive trade."

        d:"A king defeated in a battle committing ritual suicide by starving himself to death",
        ans:"ans4",
        detail:"<hr>The correct answer is Option 4:- Sangam poems are pervaded with a warrior ethic. The goal of the hero of the Puram poems was pukal (glory, fame) and a heroic death was greatly valued. It was believed that the spirit of a warrior who died in battle dwelt in paradise. A poem in the Purananuru suggests that the bodies of warriors who did not die in battle were cut with swords before the funerary rites, to simulate death in battle. The practice of vattakirutal was one in which a defeated king committed ritual suicide by starving himself to death, accompanied by those who had been close to him during his lifetime. The worship of memorial stones (natukal) was a corollary of the importance of the heroic ideal. Memorial stones were erected in honor of heroes who died fighting valiantly in battle; the spirit of the fallen hero was believed to reside in these stones. "
